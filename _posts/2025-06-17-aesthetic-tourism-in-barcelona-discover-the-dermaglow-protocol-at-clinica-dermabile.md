Our exclusive **Dermaglow Summer Protocol** is perfect for those who want to **refresh and enhance their skin’s appearance without any downtime**, so you can continue enjoying your trip while taking care of your skin.



## Welcome to Clínica Dermábile: Aesthetic Dermatology with a Personal Touch

Located in the heart of Barcelona, **Clínica Dermábile** has become a trusted destination for both local and international clients seeking **advanced aesthetic care**. What makes us different? Our commitment to **individualised attention**, **professional excellence**, and a warm, welcoming atmosphere.

Each treatment is fully tailored to your **skin type, lifestyle, and aesthetic goals**, ensuring safe, visible results while you're on the move.



## 💧 Dermaglow: The Perfect Skin Treatment to Enjoy During Your Stay in Barcelona

Our **Dermaglow Summer Protocol** is designed to suit **all skin types and tones**, including sensitive, acne-prone, or pigment-prone skin. This non-invasive, revitalising treatment enhances skin quality without interrupting your travel plans — **no peeling, redness, or recovery time**.

Ideal for:

* **Boosting skin hydration and glow**
* Minimising **fine lines, enlarged pores, and uneven texture**
* Giving your skin a healthy, smooth, and luminous appearance
* Feeling refreshed and confident while exploring the city



## ✨ What’s Included in the Dermaglow Protocol?

Each treatment is adapted to your skin after an in-clinic consultation. A typical Dermaglow session includes:

* **Deep cleansing with Aquapure + Cooling:** eliminates impurities and soothes the skin using advanced Korean technology.
* **Superficial, summer-safe peels:** exfoliate gently without irritating or compromising the skin barrier.
* **Superficial facial HIFU:** targets **pores and fine lines** with a lifting and tightening effect.
* **Vitamin infusion with micro-microneedling:** uses **very superficial microneedling** to deliver **premium medical-grade vitamins and antioxidants** directly into the skin, enhancing radiance and protection.
* **Anti-inflammatory LED light therapy:** reduces redness, regulates sebum, and stimulates regeneration without any heat or damage.
* **Algae Peel-Off mask:** a refreshing, hydrating finish to calm and seal in all the benefits.

💡 **No pain, no peeling, and no downtime — just glowing, healthy skin you’ll love showing off.**
